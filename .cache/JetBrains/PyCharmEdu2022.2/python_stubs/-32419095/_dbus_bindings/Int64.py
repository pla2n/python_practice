"""
Low-level Python bindings for libdbus. Don't use this module directly -
the public API is provided by the `dbus`, `dbus.service`, `dbus.mainloop`
and `dbus.mainloop.glib` modules, with a lower-level API provided by the
`dbus.lowlevel` module.

    dbus.Int64(value: int[, variant_level: int])
    
    A signed 64-bit integer between -0x8000 0000 0000 0000 and
    +0x7FFF FFFF FFFF FFFF, represented as a
    subtype of ``long`` in Python 2 or ``int`` in Python 3.
    
    Note that this may be changed in future to be a subtype of `int` on
    64-bit platforms; applications should not rely on either behaviour.
    
    ``value`` must be within the allowed range, or `OverflowError` will be
    raised.
    
    :py:attr:`variant_level` must be non-negative; the default is 0.
    
    .. py:attribute:: variant_level
    
        Indicates how many nested Variant containers this object
        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing an int64, this is represented in Python by an
        Int64 with variant_level==2.
